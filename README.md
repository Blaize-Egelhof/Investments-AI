## Features 

In the section below I will highlight each section of my website and explain its purpose , as well as why I have decided to implement each section and feature ! 

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all 4 pages .
  - This section will allow my potential investors to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button. 
  -Each Navigation bar is different depending on what page you are on. IE , if a users on the sign-up page , the sign-up a link will be removed and vise versa.
  -In my Navigation bar I have a sign-up link , login link and meet-the team link . 
  -I have chosen to incorporate these links with the following ideas in mind:
     *As a potential investor who may be interested in signing up and finding out more about our services we offer it is a given to have a sign-up link in order to make direct contact between our team and our potential clients. 
     *As an investor who is already a client of ours a login page is needed in order for our client to login to their uniquily setup account to view their investments. 
     *Finally , regardless of if you are an existing client or potential client , we have a page dedicated to our 2 main teams who work with our clients investments , this page introduces a more welcoming and anti-corporate approach which to typical investment firm , with the intent of painting our firm as more open , trustworthy and friendly!

- __The landing page Section__

  - This landing page includes a very suttle hero image with a white text overlay with 2 anker links. 
  - The anker links are included to give a user the option to sign-up OR login if the user has already decided to do business     
    with my investment firm after reading the main text included on the landing page.
  - This section gives a very clear explanation about who we are as an investment firm.
  - I am aware of the contrast errors given when using WAVE on the landing page. I have chosen to include the errors for  
    aesthetic purposes as the background doesnt reduce visability of the text while keeping everything clean and simplistic.

![Landing Page](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_landing.png)

- __Why Choose Us Section__

  - This section consists of a static background image with text and 2 anker tags .
  - This section was designed with the following questions in mind , "Why Choose our investment firm over others?" "What makes  
    our investment firm unique?"
  - These questions are quickly answered by the short and simple paragraph explaining what makes us the ideal choice over other 
    investment firms. 
  - I purposely included the same links mentioned in the landing page in the rare scenario that a potential client may have 
    already decided to do business with us after reading the why choose us section of our index page, and would like to sign-up or alternativly login if they are existing clients! 
  - This section is valuable to investors who seek a clear answer to the above mentioned questions without the need of redundant 
    and/or unessary information as many investment firms incorporate in the attempts to "Hide any clause's and/or valuable   
    information which may contridict earlier statments" This plays a big part in my attempt to appear as transparent , honest and trustworthy as possible . 

![Why Choose Us Section](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_ethos.png)

- __Meet The Head Team Section__

  - This section is to show the names and faces of our  VIP members who represent Investments AI to all potential and current   
    cliental. 
  - In this section there are 3 different profiles seperating images , names and their respective titles.
  - This again plays into the idea I am trying to communicate honesty , transparency and trustworthyness to all clients . With  
    the idea of seeing the main faces of the people who manage your money as an investor gives you a greater sense of relief as there is a person to blame if something goes wrong , but also emphasis that we as an investment firm have nothing to hide from our investors , indirectly building trust with our clientale. 
  - I have decided to keep the page as simple as possible and to get straight to the point in order to help accomadate potential 
    new investors who are skeptical about giving their money to our firm. 

![Meet The Head Team Section](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_times.png)

- __The Footer__ 

  - A footer section that contains the phone number and email address to directly get in contact with us. 
  - This footer section is valuable to users who have more questions that need to be answered before they even consider signing  
    up with us. This way they do not have to complete the sign-in form in order to get in contact. This gives them options for contacting us ! 

![Footer](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_footer.png)

- __Sign Up Form__

  - This form is dedicated to present a sign up form which contains a simple form that is intended for first time users signing  
    up  
  - This section is valuable to first time potential clients who want to sign up and further enquire about plans etc. 

![Gallery](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_gallery.png)

- __Login Form__

  - This section is dedicated to present a login form to any existing cliental who wish to login to their private accounts.

![Login Form](https://github.com/lucyrush/readme-template/blob/master/media/love_running_signup.png)

### Features Left to Implement

- A seperate dedicated page which can pull client data from a server side and display it for exsting clients who Login.
- I am unable to implement such a page due to time contraints and lack of knowledge about back-end data management as well as 
  JavaScript
- A static page which lets users know that they have succesfully submitted the Sign-Up form to avoid users filling in forms       multiple times , I have not implemented this design due to time constraints.

## Testing 
**TEST** | **ACTION** | **EXPECTATION** | **RESULT** 
----------|----------|----------|----------
Home page	| Size to 320px using Chrome Dev Tools	| Elements look good @ 320px | huh??
Home page	| Size to 1920px using Chrome Dev Tools | Elements look good 1920px | Works as expected
Home page	| Test Using WAVE | Pass all checks with no errors| 7 Contrast errors found , chose to keep the errors for aestheic purposes and as the text contrast errors do not reduce visability
Contact form | Click send button without data in form fields | Cannot submit form | Works as expected
Nav bar - home page | Click nav buttons | That each nav element takes me to the correct page site page | Works as expected

## Other General Project Advice

Below you will find a couple of extra tips that may be helpful when completing your project. Remember that each of these projects will become part of your final portfolio so it’s important to allow enough time to showcase your best work! 

- One of the most basic elements of keeping a healthy commit history is with the commit message. When getting started with your project, read through [this article](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams on How to Write  a Git Commit Message 
  - Make sure to keep the messages in the imperative mood 

- When naming the files in your project directory, make sure to consider meaningful naming of files, point to specific names and sections of content.
  - For example, instead of naming an image used ‘image1.png’ consider naming it ‘landing_page_img.png’. This will ensure that there are clear file paths kept. 

- Do some extra research on good and bad coding practices, there are a handful of useful articles to read, consider reviewing the following list when getting started:
  - [Writing Your Best Code](https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/writing-your-best-code/)
  - [HTML & CSS Coding Best Practices](https://medium.com/@inceptiondj.info/html-css-coding-best-practice-fadb9870a00f)
  - [Google HTML/CSS Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html#General)

Getting started with your Portfolio Projects can be daunting, planning your project can make it a lot easier to tackle, take small steps to reach the final outcome and enjoy the process!
